DEVID	Device
0	Console Keyboard
1	Console Printer
2	Card Reader
3-31	Console Registers, switches, etc

Notes:
(1) You may only use the IN and CHK instructions with the console keyboard and the card reader.
(2) You may only use the OUT and CHK instruction with the console printer.
(3) Devices 3 â€“ 31 are affected only by the IN and OUT opcodes.
    Some of these devices may be affected by only one of these opcodes.

Your simulator will have a GUI. 
It should have a pane that simulates the console printer and a pane that simulates the console keyboard.

You can implement the console printer as a text field to which you can only print.

You can implement the console keyboard as a text field into which you can type characters and numbers,
e.g., you do not have to simulate the actual keyboard. Too much work.
